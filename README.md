# El-Gamal-Scheme-with-Socket-Programming
This program contains socket programming where communication between client and server is end-to-end encrypted by El-Gamal public-key encryption scheme.

File el_gamal.py contains functions required for key generation, encryption, decryption and some auxiliary functions to used in formatting input and output to encryption/decryption functions.

client.ipynb and server.ipynb contain client side and server side code respectively.

File El-Gamal Crypto-scheme is for demonstrating how El-Gamal works.

Prime number of 84 bits (25 digitss) is used.

Download pyecm.py from https://github.com/martingkelly/pyecm which was used for finding prime factors of large numbers in a very less time.
